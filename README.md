# Catch-the-ball-game
This c programme is ball catching game we enjoyed back then in our Nokia phones. Important note : this code was made in turboC compiler which is outdated now , so it might or might not work in today's compilers.This code basically throws ball randomly and user ( gamer ) catches the ball in the basket ðŸ§º.
